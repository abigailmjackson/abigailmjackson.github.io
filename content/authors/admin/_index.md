I am a PhD student in the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology program, studying Medical Engineering and Medical Physics (bioengineering concentration). I am currently working with Alex Balazs and Debora Marks on questions surrounding HIV viral evolution. It is my hope that this research will inform future HIV vaccine and therapeutic design.
